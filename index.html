                    <p class="greeting">Hey there,</p>
                    <p>I wanted to reach out personally because you've already experienced the power of our Launch Accelerator‚Äîwhere we doubled, tripled, or even 10x'd your business by building rock-solid foundations and pushing hard for those big leaps or you thought about Launch but it just wasn't the right fit.</p>
                    
                    <p>Launch was intense‚Äîlong hours, lots of spreadsheets, deadlines, and a super structured program. For those of you who graduated it was exactly what you needed to break through those early barriers and get the fundamentals locked in.</p>
                    
                    <p>Now, if you're in a place where your systems are humming and you're looking for that next level of growth‚Äî<strong>without the grind</strong>‚Äîlet's talk about 1-on-1 GROW coaching.</p>
                    
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <p><strong>GROW is different.</strong> It's not a bootcamp. There's no rigid schedule, no required workshops, and definitely no overwhelm. Instead, it's highly bespoke. We focus on scaling your business in a way that honors your work-life balance and your bigger life goals.</p>

                    <p>You get direct access to me for CEO-level support, strategic guidance, and accountability‚Äîtailored to exactly where you want to go, both in business and life.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you're ready to scale up, but want to do it in a way that feels sustainable and aligned, let's chat.</p>
